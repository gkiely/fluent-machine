This weekend
- Get coverage to 100% and set threshold
- Support adding invoke, etc. to global transition
- Goal: get nested and parallel states working
- Move away from @xstate/fsm
- Add support for passing actions to state chart

- Write fsm test for invoke
- Add an invoke example with a working api call
- Nested states/transisions


V2
- Update invoke to be a void async function where you can call send()

- Add badge to show gzip payload size and coverage
- Write your own state machine
  - Update credit -> inspired by

- Add to FAQ
  - Why JSX/XML?

Feedback
- Support JSON
- Add docs for each method
  - When does when fire? Is it always subscribed?
- Add some examples and use cases
  - When would I use a state machine and why
  - State machine vs. redux
  - Form
  - Be able to click to an actual example

- SCXML
 - Update readme: Spec compliant finite state machines using JSX, SCXML or JSON and chainable methods.
  // Create a machine (also supports SCXML or Xstate JSON)
- Move to using this syntax
// Potentially move to this syntax
// machine.when('sleeping')
// .transition('walk')
// .cond(({ speed }) => speed > 0);
// .transition('sleep');

- Test it in the browser
  - Do you need to use this?
  https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#warning-treating-module-as-external-dependency
  https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/node-resolve
- Update readme .5h
  - Show how to render on https://xstate.js.org/viz/
  - Note that this is very much not ready for production use, until v1.0
- See if you can get an example state chart with scion 2h
https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION
  - If yes, update readme
- Message base-e group
- Read through xstate spec, add any additional methods 2h

Tuesday
- Post to twitter
- Post to r/javascript for feedback

Later
- Push to hackernews

If time:
- Nested states
- Parallel states
